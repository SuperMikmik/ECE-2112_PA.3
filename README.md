<h3>Problem 1:</h3>
<h4>Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations: <br><br> a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas <br>b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.</h4>
This problem is straightforward as the parameters of the problem, the equation, and the function needed are all indicated in the instructions. With this knowledge, we just need to create a 5 x 5 random array with the .random function. Complete the normalization equation with the random array, save the values, and then the problem is solved.<br><br>

<h3>Problem 2:</h3>
<h4>Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations. <br> <br>
a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars. <br>
b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’. <br>
c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have? <br>
d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have. <br>
</h4>
The tricky part about this problem is the syntax of the iloc and loc functions. I had issues with the brackets and curly braces. Besides that, the problem was also straightforward.<br><br>
